## (not yet released), version 0.2.0

- Implemented full touch support for Graph.
- Fixed initial empty range in the Timeline in case of a single item.
- Fixed field `className` not working for items.


## 2013-06-20, version 0.1.0

  and edges instead of a row based array internally. Methods getSelection and
  setSelection of Graph now accept a list with ids instead of rows.
- Graph is now robust against edges pointing to non-existing nodes, which
  can occur easily while dynamically adding/removing nodes and edges.

- Added documentation on DataSet and DataView.
- Fixed selection of nodes in a Graph when the containing web page is scrolled.
- Improved date conversion.
